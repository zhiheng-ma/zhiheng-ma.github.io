<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
Hi😄! I'm Zhiheng Ma (马智恒), an Assistant Professor, PI and Ph.D. Supervisor in the Faculty of Computility Microelectronics (算力微电子学院) at Shenzhen University of Advanced Technology (SUAT, 深圳理工大学). Prior to this, I was an Assistant Research Professor at Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I had the privilege to work with Prof. <a href='https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~lhy2015'>Huiyun Li</a>. I received my Ph.D. in 2021 from Xi'an Jiaotong University, under the supervision of IEEE Fellow Prof. <a href='https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/ygong'>Yihong Gong</a> and co-supervision of Prof. <a href='https://hongxiaopeng.com'>Xiaopeng Hong</a>.

My research lies at the fascinating intersection of Computer Vision, AI for Science, and Brain-inspired Intelligence. I am particularly passionate about three cutting-edge areas: Continual Learning (enabling AI systems to learn and adapt continuously), Data-efficient Learning (making AI more practical with limited data), and Multi-modal Learning (integrating information from multiple sources like human brains do). The ultimate goal of my research is to develop intelligent agents that can mirror human-like capabilities - autonomously conducting scientific exploration, continuously acquiring and adapting knowledge, and maintaining long-term memory.

I have published more than 30 papers in top-tier AI journals and conferences. For more details about my research work, please check my Google Scholar profile <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>. I am actively seeking motivated students who share my passion for advancing the frontiers of AI and developing next-generation intelligent systems. If you're interested in joining my research group, please feel free to reach out!

**We are looking for Ph.D. students, Master students, Postdoctoral researchers, Research Assistants, and Research Interns! If you're interested, please email me (mazhiheng@suat-sz.edu.cn) with your CV.** For admission details and requirements, please check <a href='https://zs.suat-sz.edu.cn/info/1010/1291.htm'>here</a>.
